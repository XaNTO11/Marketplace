# QA Site by Kristian

This is a small example of an "questions and answers" site built on the MERN stack. It's not production ready and serves primarily as an example of using the MERN stack. 

The technology is
* Client written in React
* A node.js server application based on express.js
* Mongoose used to persist data to MongoDB
